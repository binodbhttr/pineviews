Collection of my Pine Scripts for TradingView designed to combine multiple technical indicators into a single composite metric, provide trend analysis and thus providing clear buy and sell signals. The script also calculates expected high and low price levels when these signals are triggered, displaying them as horizontal arrows on the chart.

## Features

- **Composite Metric**: Combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Stochastic Oscillator, and Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) into a single metric.
- **Buy and Sell Signals**: Provides clear buy and sell signals based on the composite metric. These signals are enhanced with VSA to indicate whether the signal is supported by volume analysis.
- **Expected High/Low Levels**: Calculates and plots expected high and low levels based on the Average True Range (ATR) and momentum adjustments. These levels are visualized on the chart as horizontal arrows.
- **Real-Time Plotting**: The indicator dynamically updates and plots buy/sell signals and expected high/low levels in real-time as market conditions change.


## Usage

1. **Apply the Script**: Add desired script as an indicator to your TradingView chart.
2. **Customize Parameters**: Adjust the indicator parameters to fit your trading style and the asset being analyzed.
3. **Monitor Signals**: Watch for buy and sell signals on the chart. The expected high and low levels will guide you on potential price movements after the signal is triggered.
4. **Use Sensitivity Tuner**: Fine-tune the sensitivity of the expected high/low levels using the `Sensitivity Tuner` parameter to adapt to different market conditions.


## Notes

- These indicators are designed to provide real-time signals based on a combination of well-known technical indicators. However, like all technical analysis tools, it should be used in conjunction with other analysis methods and risk management strategies.
- The script allows customization of key parameters, enabling traders to adapt the indicator to different timeframes and asset classes.
